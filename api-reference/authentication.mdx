All API requests should include your API key in an Authorization HTTP header as follows:

```bash
'Authorization': 'Bearer <CHATTER_API_KEY>'
```

## API Keys

The Chatter API uses API keys for authentication. Go to [Chatter Platform](https://platform.trychatter.ai) to generate an API key from the user menu > Chatter SDK.

Remember that your API key is a secret! Do not share it with others or expose it in any client-side code (browsers, apps). Production requests must be routed through your own backend server where your API key can be securely loaded from an environment variable or key management service.
