## Getting started

Chatter is an LLM testing and iteration platform. Iterate on prompts, run them across model families and evaluate
them against test cases â€“ all in one place. With collaboration features, bring the whole team onboard. Engineers can
design LLM chains while QA/Domain Experts can write test cases.

Alongside Chatter Platform is our SDK and API. While they are best used in conjuction with Chatter Platform, features like
Chatterfile can be used independently. We want to keep as much of Chatter open source as possible, so you can use it!
