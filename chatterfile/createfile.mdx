## Syntax

Chatterfile uses a slightly annotated form of YAML. You can input data using standard YAML
and then mark it using tags such as @prompt_id for prompts or @config for configurations.
Data following the @ tag is associated with the tag until the next tag is encountered.

## Prompts

Input prompts using the @prompt_id tag. The prompt_id is used to reference the prompt in your code.
Each prompt must have a unique id or it may be overwritten. Within the prompt body, you can include
the model_family, model, prompt, params and more.

```yaml Example Prompt
@prompt_id: privilege
model_family: OpenAI
model: gpt-3.5-turbo
prompt: "prompt here as jinja2 template or formatted python string"
params:
	temperature: 0
```

## Key Sets

Input API keys for LLMs to be used when running Chatterfile prompts. You can store them as references
to environment variables (< 30 char) or as strings (> 30 char). You can select which key set to use when
running prompts by passing the key_id to the `key_id` argument. It defaults to the first key set declaration
in the Chatterfile

```yaml Example Key Set
@keys: production
OpenAI: OPENAI_API_KEY
Anthropic: "2c413de8-d5dc-4efc-a0f3-995cd6f7803e"
```
