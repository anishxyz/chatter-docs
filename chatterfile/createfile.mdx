## Syntax

Chatterfile uses a slightly annotated form of YAML. You can input data using standard YAML
and then mark it using tags such as @prompt_id for prompts or @config for configurations.
Data following the @ tag is associated with the tag until the next tag is encountered.

## Prompts

Input prompts using the @prompt_id tag. The prompt id is used to reference the prompt in your code.
Each prompt must have a unique id or it may be overwritten. Within the prompt body, you can include
the model_family, model, prompt and params.

```yaml
@prompt_id: privilege
model_family: OpenAI
model: gpt-3.5-turbo
prompt: "prompt here as jinja2 template or formatted python string"
params:
	temperature: 0
```
