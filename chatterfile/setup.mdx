## Get started

Start with importing the Chatterfile class from the Chatter SDK.

```python
from chatter_sdk import Chatterfile
```

## Accessing the Chatterfile

If your chatterfile is in the same directory and titled 'Chatterfile' you can simply call the Chatterfile class.

```python
chatterfile = Chatterfile()
```

If you have titled it something else (we recommend calling it Chatterfile!) or its in a different directory,
you can use the path argument to specify the path to your Chatterfile.

```python
chatterfile = Chatterfile(path='path/to/Chatterfile')
```
