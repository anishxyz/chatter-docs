## Setup

Interact with Chatter using our Python SDK (Node coming soon!) or our API. To get the full experience, we
recommend creating an account on Chatter Platform first to get your API key. You can still use parts of
our SDK like Chatterfile without a key!

### Python SDK

```python
pip install chatter-sdk
```

### Chatter API
```python Base URL
https://backend.trychatter.ai/sdk
```
