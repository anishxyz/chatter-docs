## What is a Testing Suite?

A testing suite is where you can test/run a chain on Chatter Platform. Every chain has an associate testing suite on Chatter.
A testing suite is made up of test cases which are used to test the chain. A basic test case is a set of inputs and expected outputs via assertions.
Prompts may contain variables and you can assign unique values to them in a test case. You can run your chain in many configurations
in the testing suite, from a single cell, a single test case to all test cases in the suite.

## Accessing the testing suite

1. Open your workspace in Chatter

2. Navigate to the chain you would like to test/run

3. Click on the beaker in the top right corner. It will open the testing panel on the right side of the screen.

## Running a chain in the testing suite

There are many run configuration options in Chatter. You can run a single cell, a single test case, or all test cases in the suite.

### Running a single test cae on a single cell

1. Navigate to the test case to run

2. Find the output box of the cell you would like to run (they are in the same order as the cells in the chain)

3. Click the `Run Test on ___` button to run the test case on a specific cell

4. After the test case has finished running, the output box will be updated with the results of the test case.
You can find details of the run in the history panel under the 'Cell Histories' tab and a brief summary in the bottom right corner of the results box.

### Running a single test case

1. Navigate to the test case to run

2. Click the `Run Test on Chain` button to run the test case on all cells in the chain.

3. After the test case has finished running, the output box(es) will be updated with the results of the test case.
You can find details of the run in the history panel under the 'Chain Histories' tab and a brief summary in the bottom right corner of the results box.
A banner will also update at the top of the test case with a summary of the run.

### Running an entire testing suite

1. Navigate to the testing suite to run

2. Click the `Run Suite` button at the top of the testing panel

3. After the test case has finished running, the output box(es) will be updated in each test case.
You can find details of the run in the history panel under the 'Chain Histories' tab.
A banner will also update at the top of the testing panel with a summary of the run.

# Test Cases

## Creating a test case

1. Navigate to the testing suite that you would like to add a test case to

2. Click on the `Add Chain` button towards the top of the testing panel

3. A new test case will appear at the bottom of the accordion of test cases. Click on the last one to open the newly added test case.

## Setting up variables in a test case

1. Navigate to the test case that you would like to set up

2. Variables in the chain will automatically be added to the test case. You can assign values to them by editing the text box next to the variable name.
This is the text that the variables will be replaced with in prompt. If you are inputting large format text, it may be helpful to hover and click on the
`Expand` button to open a larger text box.

3. (optional) If you would like to change the 'type' of the variable, navigate to the `Variable Configuration` accordion. Here you can change the type of any variable in the chain.
Chatter will convert the input to the type you specify. For example, if you have a variable that is a number, you can change the type to `number` and Chatter will convert the input to a number.
This can be especially powerful when using Jinja2 to format your prompt.
