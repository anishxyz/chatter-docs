## What is a Chain?

A chain is a series of prompts run in sequence. A chain is made up of cells, each of which represents a call to an LLM.
A chain in Chatter has a global set of variables. This allows for powerful functionality such as passing data between prompts or from
external sources.

## Creating a Chain

1. Open your workspace in Chatter

2. Navigate to the collection you would like to add a chain to

3. Click the plus "+" button to the right of the collection name

4. Name your chain and click the ENTER key.
    (optional) if you are testing a chatbot, click the checkbox on the left to enable the chain as a chatbot.

5. Click on the chain you just created to open it. It will open as a new tab in the workspace.
