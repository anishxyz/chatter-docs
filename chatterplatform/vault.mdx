## What is a Vault?

A vault is a secure place to store secrets. Most LLMs require API keys in order to access them. These can be securely
stored in a Chatter Vault. Simply put, a vault is a configuration of API keys. You select a model family (ex. OpenAI) and input a key for it.
Whenever the vault is active, the API key will be used for all models in that family.
For example you could have one for prod, dev and staging to track costs. Or you could have one for each of your projects. The choice is yours.

<Note>You must have an active vault with a valid key for a model family in order to use the model family in your workspace</Note>
